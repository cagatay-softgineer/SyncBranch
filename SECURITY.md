# Security Policy

At **SyncBranch**, we take the security of our users and their data seriously. We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities and are committed to addressing any issues promptly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **SyncBranch**, we ask that you report it as soon as possible using the following steps:

1. **Do not publicly disclose** the vulnerability until it has been addressed.  
2. **Contact us directly** at [cagatayalkan@yggbranch.dev]. Please include:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any other relevant information (e.g., logs, screenshots).

## Accepted Vulnerabilities

We will accept reports for vulnerabilities such as:

- Authentication and authorization flaws.
- Data leaks (e.g., personal data exposure).
- Vulnerabilities in communication channels (e.g., unencrypted API calls).
- Denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.

We will not accept reports for:

- Low-risk vulnerabilities that require unusual conditions to exploit.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services integrated with SyncBranch (e.g., Spotify API).

## Process

Once we receive a report, we will:

1. Acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**.
2. Assess the issue and assign a severity rating.
3. Provide an estimated timeline for addressing the issue.
4. Work on a fix and notify the reporter once resolved.

## Disclosure

After a vulnerability has been addressed, we will publicly disclose the issue, credit the reporter, and provide details about the fix.

## Security Best Practices

- **Use Strong Passwords**: Always use strong, unique passwords for your accounts and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) when available.
- **Update Regularly**: Keep your device and app up-to-date to ensure you have the latest security patches.
- **Be Cautious of Phishing Attempts**: Be mindful of unsolicited messages asking for personal information.
