**Disclaimer:** 
This example uses `time.sleep` to illustrate scheduling in a naive manner,

- Running the scheduled tasks externally (e.g., cron job, Airflow, etc.).
- Using a background thread or asynchronous approach.
- Using Streamlitâ€™s [experimental async features](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/control-flow/st.experimental.asyncio).
