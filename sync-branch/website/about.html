                <h2>What is SyncBranch?</h2>
                <p>SyncBranch is an innovative mobile application that invites you to discover your unique music identity, inspired by the World Tree, Yggdrasil. Through analyzing your Spotify listening habits, SyncBranch classifies users into unique music archetypes, such as "Dreamer" or "Rhythm Seeker." It then connects you with others who share similar music preferences.</p>

                <h2>Spotify Integration</h2>
                <p>Users securely connect their Spotify accounts, allowing SyncBranch to access their listening history, playlists, and audio features (e.g., tempo, energy, mood). SyncBranch processes this data to create personalized music profiles that reflect your unique listening habits.</p>

                <h2>Yggdrasil: The Mythical Inspiration</h2>
                <p>At the heart of SyncBranch is Yggdrasil, the legendary tree of Norse mythology. Yggdrasil represents the interconnectedness of all things—just as this mythical tree connects the nine worlds of Norse cosmology, SyncBranch connects people through the shared experience of music. The branches of Yggdrasil symbolize the cosmic balance of life, death, and rebirth.</p>
